## Summary
Safely is an App that provides COVID-19 testing site data to our users. 

Primarily, we wanted to focus on creating a one-stop-shop for COVID testing sites. As we have noticed over the pandemic, that it has been increasingly difficult to find accurate information on COVID-19, especially available testing sites. 

This app allows our users to search for testing sites in their area. We also feature information regarding types of tests one can take, travel information regarding COVID-19 and tests, and recommendations from the CDC, among other things...

In the future, we plan to allow users to log their test results through their own accounts on Safely. This will allow people to have a history of their results in one place. Something, we have noticed has become troublesome with travel restrictions loosening up and increase in mobile testing centers. 

Please reach out if you have any comments or concerns. We would love to hear your feedback! 

Thank you for your time browsing our program and this README :)
