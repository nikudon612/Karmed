          accurate than their counterparts. See more...

          SARS-CoV-2 in the patients body. This is the type of test you should

          If you have symptons of COVID-19, It’s important to get tested and
          isolate until you know your results.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19, get tested
          and stay home and away from others for 14 days.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you go to a test site run by NY State, you will not be charged for
          your test.
          <br />
          <br />
          Going to a test site operated by local governments, private companies
          including pharmacies and medical practices or not-for-profit
          organizations, check with the testing site and your insurer to make
          sure there isn’t a fee for testing.
          <br />
          <br />
          if you are uninsured, you are advised to ask the testing site if you
          will be responsible for any fees associated with your test. Under the
          feder Families First Coronavirus Response Act(FFCRA), the Paycheck
          Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (PPPHCEA), and the
          Cornovirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES), a testing site
          can receive reimbursement for fees associated with testing uninsured
          individuals.
